# Income Tax Record Keeping Database System IRIS (course project)

## Project description:
Iris FBR is a computerized taxpayer facilitation portal. It has different modules depending on the type of taxpayer needs for e.g. Sales tax, income tax. A taxpayer needs an ID and password to access his portal which holds all the details of the taxpayerâ€™s previous returns and NTN registration. Link to iris FBR: https://iris.fbr.gov.pk/public/txplogin.xhtml 

Some of its features include:
* E-Enrollment with FBR provides you with a Registration Number, password and Pin.
* Registration number for salaried taxpayers/ individuals is their 13 digits CNIC number and unique for all taxpayers. Password and pin can be the same for two taxpayers. This registration number and password must be used to log in to your IRIS FBR portal which is the only way through which income tax return can be filled.
* Once logged in, user needs to select the income tax return from the options and select the tax period for which one is filling the return
* As soon as the tax period is selected, an income tax return will open in which user can enter his income and the tax deducted on that income for the year.
* Once income tax return is filled, user needs to create a wealth statement for the tax period. No income tax return can be submitted without the Wealth statement.

The goal of this project is to design a record keeping system for Iris FBR that will keep all the records of the income tax payers/salaried taxpayers. The scope of this project is limited to the income taxpayers/salaried taxpayers and the administrator of the IRIS system. I have created both the front end and the back end of this record keeper.
